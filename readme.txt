This plugin makes it easy to add Google Maps to your WordPress post, pages or other custom post types.

== Description ==

<h1 class="entry-title">
  Google Maps
</h1>

## So what does this Google Maps plugin do?

With this plugin a user can easily add location (latitude, longitude) meta data to a page, post or a custom post type. This plugin adds a meta box with an Google Map to the post editor. Users can easily drag and drop a marker on the map to save location meta data for a post.

The nice thing about this plugin that developers can configure on wich post type the meta box should be visible. Developers can activate the meta box for every custom post type they registered with the [register\_post\_type function][1].

For example: if a developer registers a custom post type for *real estate* it is very easy to activate and manage location data for that post type. It comes in handy for all kind of custom post types!

*   Real estate
*   Ships
*   Ports
*   Restaurants
*   Accomodations
*   Hotels
